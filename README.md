# YuncongCrowdCounting

This is my commited model for Yuncong Crowd Counting Competition. It is based on **PyramidBox**(2018), similar to the model of the 1st team in competition. Mine won 3rd prize luckily.

The detailed introduction is shown in _GGSDT_PyramidBox/ModelGuidance_.

I'm a noob of DeepLearning, and now working in Hikvision as an intern (now a salaried employee), focusing on instance segmentation. Welcome to contact me! Here is my email addr: luckyzsd@163.com.
